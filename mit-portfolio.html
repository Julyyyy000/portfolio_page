            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Dreamcore explores liminal spaces as psychological safe zones—quiet, transitional environments that
                feel both familiar and unreal. The project takes the form of a two-folio interactive pop-up installation
                that blends hand-crafted paper engineering with responsive digital systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                All environments were hand-drawn, digitally edited, and printed onto 100lb paper to preserve tactile ink
                texture while accommodating embedded electronics. Rather than presenting narrative through a screen
                alone,
                Dreamcore asks whether an analog, handcrafted world—augmented through Arduino-based interaction—can
                evoke
                the uncanny softness, nostalgia, and ambiguity associated with dreamcore aesthetics.

                The first folio opens to an empty classroom and a lone bicycle selling balloons. A color sensor
                connected to an ESP32
                microcontroller detects the viewer’s interaction: when a balloon object is placed “outside” the window,
                animated balloons
                drift into a dreamlike sky displayed on a TFT screen. The interaction is intentionally simple, allowing
                a single physical
                gesture to produce a quiet but emotionally resonant response.

                The second folio reveals fading storefronts and a silent movie theater. Using a rotary input, viewers
                can tilt the TFT
                display toward themselves—confronting their own presence within the emptiness—or watch a half-forgotten
                moment: a kiddie ride
                outside an abandoned shop slowly rocking on its own. These interactions are designed to feel restrained
                rather than instructional,
                encouraging reflection rather than task-based engagement.

            <p>
                Dreamcore integrates pop-up paper structures, origami-based mechanisms, hand illustration, and physical
                computing into a single
                system. I worked with the Arduino IDE on an ESP32 microcontroller, integrating color sensors, rotary
                inputs, and TFT displays with
                Processing-based visuals.
            </p>

            <p>
                Building the project required repeated cycles of cutting, folding, measuring, coding, redrawing, and
                rebuilding. Pop-up stability,
                sensor reliability, wiring layout, and screen placement were tested and revised through multiple
                iterations. The physical constraints
                of paper engineering directly informed the electronic system design, requiring careful coordination
                between structure, circuitry, and code.
            </p>

            <p>
                Through this process, I developed a workflow that balances precision with openness—designing interactive
                systems that are structurally
                sound while remaining emotionally ambiguous. Dreamcore ultimately reinforced my interest in creating
                hybrid environments where meaning
                emerges through the tension between analog craft and digital response.

            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Safe Space is an interactive projection-mapped installation that explores how anxiety and uncertainty
                can destabilize one’s sense of reality—even within spaces typically associated with comfort and safety.
                The work takes place inside a miniature bedroom constructed from wooden boards and clay-made furniture,
                onto which animated imagery and sound are projected.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project centers on a character who lives within this room. As viewers interact with different
                objects, the memories associated with those objects change, and the character responds through shifting
                facial expressions and breathing patterns. While a bedroom is often understood as a quiet getaway, Safe
                Space challenges this assumption by revealing how internal doubt and cognitive instability can transform
                even the most familiar environments into sources of distress.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rather than telling a fixed narrative, the installation invites viewers to experience a gradual
                emotional shift—from curiosity to unease—through interaction, sound, and visual disruption.
            </p>

                The physical environment was intentionally handcrafted. Furniture and the character were sculpted from
                paper clay, creating neutral, unfinished surfaces that function as blank canvases for projected memory.
                Early prototypes explored 3D-printed forms and Unity-based projection, but these were abandoned in favor
                of clay and wood, which better supported the project’s intimacy and emotional tone.
            </p>

            <p>
                Projection mapping required extensive experimentation. I worked with multiple projector
                configurations—eventually combining a front-facing projector with a top-down projection—to ensure that
                imagery could inhabit both architectural surfaces and small object details. A physical clay character
                replaced early animated character concepts to avoid visual distortion during projection.
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                User testing revealed a consistent emotional arc. Participants often described the space as “cute” or
                calm at first, followed by discomfort, stress, and concern for the character. Feedback confirmed that
                the gradual loss of control—rather than sudden disruption—was key to the work’s emotional impact. The
                project also revealed technical limitations, including fragility during transport and sensitivity to
                prolonged interaction, which informed my understanding of scalability and robustness in interactive
                installations.
            </p>

            <p>
                Safe Space represents my interest in creating environments where interaction is not about solving a
                problem, but about inhabiting an emotional condition—using system behavior, physical materials, and
                audience input to communicate experiences that are difficult to articulate verbally.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each piece of furniture in the room functions as an interactive trigger. Viewers use a handheld keyboard
                to activate different objects, prompting changes in projected imagery and sound. Initially, interactions
                feel controlled and exploratory: objects shuffle gently, and the character breathes calmly.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, sustained or repeated input causes the system to destabilize. Projections accelerate, audio
                glitches intensify, and the character’s breathing becomes rapid and panicked. When multiple objects are
                activated simultaneously, the room becomes chaotic—mirroring the experience of intrusive thoughts and
                cognitive overload.
            </p>

            <p>
                The system was built in TouchDesigner using keyboard input to control video playback, animation states,
                and sound layers. Rather than rewarding mastery, the interaction is designed to resist control. The more
                users attempt to “fix” or stabilize the space, the more unstable it becomes—reflecting cycles of doubt
                and anxiety that escalate through repeated checking and rumination.
            </p>

            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Night By Exam is a 2D pixel-art narrative puzzle game that explores exam anxiety, intrusive thoughts,
                and the emotional pressure surrounding academic performance. Developed for the 2024 Mental Health
                Champion game jam, the game uses looping environments and narrative-driven puzzles to depict cycles of
                self-criticism and avoidance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Players control a protagonist preparing for an exam late at night. Although the exit from the room is
                physically accessible, the player repeatedly remains inside, navigating familiar objects and fragmented
                notes. This looping structure reflects the difficulty of confronting fear directly, and the tendency to
                stay within known routines even when they become distressing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rather than dramatizing mental illness, the game presents anxiety as a quiet, internal
                struggle—expressed through environmental repetition, subtle visual changes, and restrained narrative
                cues.

                The game is built around traditional point-and-click mechanics combined with a looping spatial system.
                Each loop reveals small environmental changes: notes shift, objects gain new meanings, and dialogue
                fragments evolve. These changes signal the protagonist’s emotional state rather than advancing a
                conventional plot.
            </p>

            <p>
                Core systems were implemented in Unity, including room-reset logic, interaction states, puzzle
                progression, and narrative triggers. Visual tone and pacing were carefully tuned to maintain a sense of
                quiet tension without overwhelming the player. Pixel art assets, character animations, and UI elements
                were all created by hand to maintain stylistic cohesion.
            </p>

            <p>
                Developing Night By Exam strengthened my understanding of how mechanics, visual language, and narrative
                structure can work together to communicate psychological states. Working solo required balancing
                programming, art production, and narrative pacing within a short time frame, reinforcing my ability to
                prototype, iterate, and polish interactive systems efficiently. The project reflects my ongoing interest
                in using games as a medium for translating internal emotional experiences into interactive form with
                nuance and care.

            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Missing Qin is a 2D pixel-art narrative puzzle game that examines how harassment and social pressure are
                often normalized or romanticized within school environments. Developed for Ludum Dare 57 by a two-person
                team, the game follows a protagonist searching for a missing classmate, gradually uncovering how
                institutional silence and peer dynamics contribute to harm.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rather than framing the mystery around a single event, the game reveals patterns of behavior through
                environmental storytelling. As players explore familiar school spaces, they encounter fragmented
                dialogue that builds up to a whole story. The narrative intentionally avoids clear villains, focusing
                instead on the collective systems that allow harm to persist.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project explores how memory, rumor, and social expectation shape what is considered “normal,” along
                with topics of how friendship persists under high pressure.
