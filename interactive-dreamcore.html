        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> designer / creator / programmer / artist</p>
        <p>
            Dreamcore is a two-folio interactive pop-up installation presenting abandoned dreamlands
            through physical paper engineering and responsive digital elements. The piece combines
            hand-drawn illustration, pop-up mechanisms, embedded electronics, and digital motion to create
            a liminal “safe space” for exploring memory and mental health.
        </p>

            <!-- START -->
            <div class="phase-card">
                <div class="phase-header">
                    <h3 class="phase-title">Start</h3>
                    <p class="phase-meta"><span class="pill">Goal + concept</span></p>
                </div>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Core idea:</strong> I explore liminal spaces as a psychological safe zone—transitional,
                        empty, ambiguous environments that evoke nostalgia and disorientation, where one can return to
                        the past without being overwhelmed by it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Why this sample:</strong> I chose Dreamcore as a creative sample because it combines
                        physical craft and responsive technology, showing my range across hand-drawn illustration,
                        analog making, and interactive systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Format:</strong> A two-folio hybrid pop-up project that studies where emotion and
                        dreamcore aesthetics intersect—an object that behaves like neither a traditional book nor a
                        conventional installation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Art foundation:</strong> Backgrounds were hand-drawn, digitally edited, and printed on
                        100lb paper to preserve ink texture while supporting embedded electronics.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <!-- PRODUCTION -->

                </div>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Folio 1 scene + interaction:</strong> An empty classroom and a lone bicycle selling
                        balloons. Through interaction, balloons drift out the window into a sky that feels familiar and
                        unreal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Folio 2 scene + interaction:</strong> Fading small shops and a vast silent movie
                        theater. With a remote control, the viewer tilts the screen toward themselves—confronting their
                        presence in emptiness—or watches a half-forgotten memory: a kiddie ride rocking outside an
                        abandoned shop.</li>
                    <li><strong>Toolchain + materials:</strong> Pop-up engineering, drawing, printmaking, origami,
                        Processing sketches, TFT display, rotary encoder, color sensor, and ESP32-based responses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Design intention:</strong> I blur the boundary between physical craft and digital
                        interaction. The project’s innovation lives in the tension between mediums—each interaction
                        becomes a small rupture where the familiar feels slightly off-center.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Viewer experience:</strong> Dreamcore aims to evoke strange comfort—empty but not
                        lonely, distorted yet gentle—creating an introspective pause where viewers briefly step outside
                        themselves.</li>
                    <li><strong>What I learned:</strong> Building Dreamcore taught me patience and resilience. Each
                        mechanism required repeated trial and error—cutting, folding, measuring, coding, redrawing, and
                        rebuilding.</li>
                    <li><strong>Technical growth:</strong> Working with pop-up structures, sensors, TFT displays, and
                        live Processing-to-display experiments pushed me to plan carefully while staying open to
                        discovery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Innovation doesn’t emerge from technology alone—it lives in the
                        overlap between mediums, memories, and dreamlike spaces in between. By weaving analog texture
                        with interactive motion, I created a space where emotion can be encountered quietly—suspended
                        between reality and a dream.</li>
                </ul>
