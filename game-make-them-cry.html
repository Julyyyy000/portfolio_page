        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> 2D programmer / narrative designer</p>
        <p>
            Make Them Cry is a narrative puzzle game created during Global Game Jam 2024.

            ​Game Direction:
            Glasses: use SPACE bar
            Juice: press the cup to fuel the robot
            Coin: use left and right arrow key to catch coins
            Candy: drag the irrelevant candies off the table

            "Make Them Cry" offers a playful and amusing gaming experience, centered around a character who is both
            exhausted and overworked. This character frequently finds themselves in the company of a loudly crying child
            during everyday situations – be it on their daily commute, on airplanes, in subway trains, or in elevator
            rides. The relentless noise drives the character to devise clever and often humorous strategies to put an
            end to the crying and make the child laugh. However, these attempts take a comical turn when they
            "unexpectedly" cause the surrounding crowd to start crying instead. Players engage with the game through a
            series of mini-games, each crafted to be simple yet entertaining. This design choice highlights the game's
            commitment to a humorous and relaxed gaming experience, ensuring a delightful and lighthearted time for all
            players.
